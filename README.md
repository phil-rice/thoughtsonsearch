# Getting going

## Install the dependencies
```bash
# install yarn https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/
yarn  
```
At this point you should be good to run an example program 
```bash
# From the root of the project
yarn example
```

In order to develop you probably want [laoban](https://www.npmjs.com/package/laoban)
```bash
npm install -g laoban
```
This is needed when we mess with packages or the build process

Documentation is [here](https://laoban.dev/)
